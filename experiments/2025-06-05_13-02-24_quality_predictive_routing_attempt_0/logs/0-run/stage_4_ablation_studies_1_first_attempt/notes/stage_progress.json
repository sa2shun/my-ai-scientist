  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments demonstrated the importance of hyperparameter tuning, particularly for the momentum parameter in optimization processes. Adjusting momentum values led to improvements in both training and validation losses, as well as quality-speed tradeoffs.\n\n- **Dataset Diversity and Robustness**: Experiments that involved creating multiple synthetic datasets with varying characteristics (e.g., linear vs. non-linear relationships, different feature correlations, and noise levels) were successful in assessing model robustness and generalization capabilities. These experiments highlighted the model's ability to adapt to different input conditions and maintain performance.\n\n- **Handling Input Shape Changes**: Successful experiments addressed issues related to input shape changes by ensuring that the model's architecture was adaptable to different input sizes. This was particularly important when features were removed or modified in the dataset.\n\n- **Bug Fixes and Initialization**: Successful experiments involved fixing bugs related to uninitialized variables and ensuring proper initialization of key variables (e.g., `quality_speed_tradeoff`) to prevent runtime errors.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Shape Mismatch Errors**: A common failure pattern was the occurrence of shape mismatch errors during matrix multiplication in the model's forward pass. This often happened when features were removed or modified without adjusting the model's input size accordingly.\n\n- **Uninitialized Variables**: Several failed experiments were due to uninitialized variables, such as `quality_speed_tradeoff` and `interaction_terms`. These errors occurred when variables were referenced before being assigned a value, particularly in conditional branches.\n\n- **Lack of Adaptability to Dataset Changes**: Some experiments failed because the model was not adaptable to changes in the dataset, such as feature removal or modification. This highlighted the need for dynamic model architectures that can handle varying input sizes and feature sets.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Dynamic Model Architectures**: Future experiments should focus on designing model architectures that can dynamically adjust to changes in input size and feature sets. This will help prevent shape mismatch errors and improve model adaptability.\n\n- **Comprehensive Initialization**: Ensure that all variables are properly initialized before use, especially in scenarios where conditional logic may lead to uninitialized variable references. This will prevent runtime errors and improve code robustness.\n\n- **Thorough Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue to emphasize hyperparameter tuning, particularly for optimization parameters like momentum, learning rate, and batch size. This can lead to significant improvements in model performance.\n\n- **Diverse Dataset Evaluation**: Incorporate diverse datasets with varying characteristics in future experiments to assess model robustness and generalization capabilities. This will provide insights into how the model performs under different conditions and help identify areas for improvement.\n\n- **Structured Error Handling**: Implement structured error handling and debugging mechanisms to quickly identify and resolve issues related to shape mismatches and uninitialized variables. This will streamline the development process and reduce the likelihood of recurring errors."
