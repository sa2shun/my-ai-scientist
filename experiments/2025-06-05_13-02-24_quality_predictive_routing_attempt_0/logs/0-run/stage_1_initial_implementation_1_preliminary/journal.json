However, the overall trend appears to stabilize around 1.05 to 1.18, suggesting that while the model is capable of achieving a reasonable quality-speed tradeoff, it may require further tuning for consistent performance. The variability in the tradeoff could imply that the model is still adapting to the dataset and may improve with additional training or adjustments to the learning algorithm.","plot_path":"experiments/2025-06-05_13-02-24_quality_predictive_routing_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_020b8150f02a493e879a6de20343ae72_proc_3630414/training_validation_losses.png"}],"vlm_feedback_summary":"The
