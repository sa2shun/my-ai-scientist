# Speculative Decoding with Multi-Model LLM Systems

## Research Topic Description

This research explores the integration of speculative decoding techniques with multi-model LLM selection systems to optimize inference efficiency and response quality. The core idea is to combine:

1. **Speculative Decoding**: Using smaller, faster models to predict tokens that are then verified by larger models, reducing computational overhead while maintaining quality.

2. **Multi-Model LLM Selection**: Dynamically selecting appropriate models based on query characteristics, similar to the LLM-MS approach.

## Key Research Questions

1. How can speculative decoding be adapted to work across multiple models with different architectures and capabilities?
2. Can query-aware model selection improve the efficiency of speculative decoding?
3. What are the optimal strategies for allocating computational resources between draft and verification models in a multi-model system?
4. How can we balance the trade-off between latency, computational cost, and output quality?

## Potential Innovations

1. **Adaptive Draft Model Selection**: Dynamically choose draft models based on query complexity and domain.
2. **Multi-Stage Speculation**: Use hierarchical speculation with models of increasing capability.
3. **Query-Aware Verification**: Adjust verification strategies based on confidence metrics and query characteristics.
4. **Cross-Model Token Sharing**: Leverage intermediate representations across different model architectures.

## Technical Challenges

- Compatibility between different model architectures
- Efficient token allocation strategies
- Real-time model selection and switching
- Maintaining coherence across model transitions

## Expected Outcomes

- Reduced inference latency compared to single large model approaches
- Lower computational costs while maintaining output quality
- A framework for efficient multi-model LLM deployment
- Empirical analysis of different speculation strategies
