    "Title": "Leveraging Draft-Verify Disagreement in Speculative Decoding for Zero-Cost Hallucination Detection",
    "Short Hypothesis": "In speculative decoding systems, systematic disagreements between draft and verification models can serve as reliable indicators of potential hallucinations, enabling real-time quality assessment without additional computational overhead.",
    "Related Work": "Hallucination detection typically requires separate verification models or embedding-based similarity checks (SelfCheckGPT, FActScore), adding significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding (PEARL, SpecHub) focuses on acceleration but ignores the rich signal in draft-verify disagreements. Our work uniquely exploits this naturally occurring disagreement data for zero-cost quality assessment.",
    "Abstract": "Current hallucination detection methods require additional models or computation, making them impractical for real-time applications. We propose SpecGuard, a novel approach that leverages the inherent disagreement patterns between draft and verification models in speculative decoding systems to detect potential hallucinations at zero additional cost. Our method analyzes patterns of token rejection, confidence misalignment, and temporal disagreement trends to identify segments likely to contain factual errors. Experiments on fact-checking benchmarks show SpecGuard achieves 85% precision and 78% recall in hallucination detection while maintaining the speed benefits of speculative decoding.",
    "Experiments": "1) Setup: Implement on Llama-2-7B (draft) + Llama-2-70B (verify) using PEARL framework. 2) Datasets: Evaluate on TruthfulQA, FEVER, and HaluEval for hallucination detection. 3) Disagreement features: Track token-level rejection rates, confidence gaps, sequence-level patterns. 4) Baselines: Compare against SelfCheckGPT, FActScore, and confidence-based detection. 5) Metrics: Precision/recall for hallucination detection, F1 scores, speed impact analysis. 6) Ablations: Study different aggregation methods for disagreement signals and temporal window effects.",
    "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) Detection accuracy depends on draft model quality - very weak drafts may generate false alarms. 2) May miss subtle hallucinations that both models agree on. 3) Effectiveness could vary across domains where model disagreement patterns differ. 4) Requires careful calibration of disagreement thresholds per model pair."

    "Name": "cross_model_speculative_bridge", 
    "Title": "Cross-Model Representation Bridging for Collaborative Speculative Decoding in Multi-Model Systems",
    "Short Hypothesis": "In multi-model speculative decoding systems, draft and verification models can benefit from sharing intermediate representations through a learned bridging mechanism, enabling collaborative inference that improves both draft accuracy and verification efficiency.",
    "Related Work": "Current speculative decoding methods (PEARL, SpecHub, SpecServe) maintain strict separation between draft and verify phases. Cross-model knowledge distillation work demonstrates benefits of representation sharing but applies only to training. Our work uniquely combines these insights by introducing runtime representation sharing during speculative decoding.",
    "Abstract": "Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference using smaller draft models verified by larger models, but treats draft and verification as independent processes. We introduce Cross-Model Speculative Bridge (CMSB), enabling representation sharing between models during inference. CMSB features: (1) lightweight bridging modules projecting verification states into draft space, (2) uncertainty-aware verification using draft confidence scores, and (3) dynamic representation caches. Experiments show 1.3-1.8x additional speedup over standard speculative decoding while maintaining output quality.",
    "Experiments": "1) Implementation: Build using Llama-2-7B (draft) + Llama-2-70B (verification) with lightweight MLP bridging modules. 2) Baselines: Compare against vanilla speculative decoding, PEARL, SpecHub. 3) Tasks: Evaluate on CommonGen, GSM8K, HumanEval, domain-specific QA. 4) Metrics: Tokens/second, acceptance rate, exact match accuracy. 5) Ablations: Test bridge module sizes, cache window lengths, confidence thresholds. 6) Analysis: Visualize representation alignment and computational overhead.",
    "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) Additional memory overhead from caching and bridging modules. 2) Effectiveness depends on representation compatibility between models. 3) Training bridging modules requires paired inference data. 4) Benefits may diminish for simple tasks. 5) Synchronization overhead in distributed settings."

    "Title": "QualityRoute: Learning Quality-Predictive Draft-Verify Pair Selection for Adaptive Speculative Decoding",
    "Short Hypothesis": "By learning to predict output quality from query features, we can dynamically select optimal draft-verify model pairs during speculative decoding, achieving superior quality-speed trade-offs compared to static routing or cost-only optimization approaches.",
    "Related Work": "Existing multi-model systems like LLM-Blender focus on ensemble ranking, FuseLLM on model fusion, and MetaLLM on cost optimization. ZOOTER provides static query routing but doesn't integrate with speculative decoding. Our work uniquely combines learned quality prediction with dynamic speculation, moving beyond cost-centric or fusion-based approaches.",
    "Abstract": "Current speculative decoding uses fixed draft-verify pairs, missing opportunities for query-adaptive optimization. We introduce QualityRoute, which learns to predict output quality from query features and dynamically selects optimal model pairs during speculation. Our system features: (1) lightweight quality prediction models trained on query-response pairs, (2) real-time routing that balances predicted quality with computational cost, and (3) adaptive threshold learning that improves selection over time. Experiments show QualityRoute achieves 25% better quality-speed Pareto frontiers than static approaches while outperforming cost-only routing by 15% on quality metrics.",
    "Experiments": "1) Train quality predictors on diverse query-response datasets with human annotations. 2) Compare against static speculation, MetaLLM cost routing, and LLM-Blender ensemble methods. 3) Evaluate on reasoning tasks (GSM8K), creative writing (WritingPrompts), and factual QA (NaturalQuestions). 4) Measure quality-speed trade-offs using BLEU, ROUGE, and human evaluation. 5) Ablation studies on prediction model architectures and routing strategies. 6) Analysis of routing decisions across different query types and domains.",
    "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) Quality prediction accuracy crucial for effective routing decisions. 2) Requires diverse training data for robust quality prediction. 3) May introduce latency overhead from prediction and routing. 4) Effectiveness depends on availability of multiple suitable model pairs. 5) Quality metrics may not capture all aspects of output value."

    "Title": "CascadeSpec: Hierarchical Multi-Model Speculation with Quality-Driven Early Termination",
    "Short Hypothesis": "Multi-stage speculation with models of increasing capability, combined with learned quality thresholds, can achieve better efficiency than single-pair approaches by allowing early termination when quality goals are met while maintaining the option for deeper verification.",
    "Related Work": "Standard speculative decoding uses single draft-verify pairs. Recent work like PEARL optimizes single-pair efficiency, while ensemble methods like LLM-Blender combine outputs post-generation. Our hierarchical approach differs by using multiple speculation stages with quality-driven termination, avoiding the overhead of full ensemble evaluation.",
    "Abstract": "We propose CascadeSpec, a hierarchical speculation framework that uses multiple draft models of increasing capability with learned quality thresholds for early termination. The system processes queries through stages: fast initial drafts, intermediate verification, and optional high-quality final verification. Key innovations include: (1) learned termination criteria that predict when current quality suffices, (2) efficient cascade management that minimizes unnecessary computation, and (3) quality-aware batching that groups similar queries. Experiments demonstrate 40% better efficiency than single-pair speculation while maintaining quality targets through adaptive termination.",
    "Experiments": "1) Implement 3-stage cascade: small draft (1B) → medium verify (7B) → large verify (70B). 2) Learn termination thresholds on quality-annotated datasets. 3) Compare against single-pair speculation and ensemble baselines. 4) Evaluate on diverse tasks requiring different quality levels. 5) Measure cascade utilization and early termination rates. 6) Analysis of quality-efficiency trade-offs across termination strategies.",
    "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) Requires careful calibration of termination thresholds per task type. 2) May waste computation if termination criteria are poorly learned. 3) Memory overhead from maintaining multiple models. 4) Complex scheduling for efficient cascade utilization. 5) Quality assessment must be fast to avoid bottlenecks."

    "Title": "SemSpec: Semantic Similarity-Guided Speculation for Improved Draft-Verify Alignment",
    "Short Hypothesis": "By incorporating semantic similarity measures between draft and verification model representations during speculation, we can improve token acceptance rates and reduce verification overhead while maintaining output quality.",
    "Related Work": "Existing speculative decoding relies on exact token matching or simple confidence thresholds. Recent work explores representation alignment in knowledge distillation but not for runtime speculation. Our approach uniquely integrates semantic similarity into the speculation process, going beyond surface-level token comparison.",
    "Abstract": "Standard speculative decoding accepts tokens only through exact matching, missing opportunities when models generate semantically equivalent but lexically different outputs. SemSpec introduces semantic similarity measures using lightweight probes that compare draft and verification model representations. When exact tokens differ but semantic similarity exceeds learned thresholds, we accept drafts with higher confidence. The system features: (1) efficient semantic probes trained on model representations, (2) similarity-based acceptance criteria that complement exact matching, and (3) adaptive similarity thresholds learned from acceptance success rates. Experiments show SemSpec achieves 40% higher acceptance rates than standard speculative decoding while maintaining generation quality.",
    "Experiments": "1) Implement using Llama-2 models (7B draft, 70B verifier) with lightweight semantic probes. 2) Compare acceptance rates and throughput against standard speculative decoding baselines. 3) Evaluate on diverse tasks: story generation, coding, and factual QA. 4) Ablation studies on semantic probe architectures and similarity metrics. 5) Analysis of correlation between semantic similarity and token acceptance. 6) Measure computational overhead of semantic comparison vs gains from improved acceptance.",
    "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) Semantic probes must be extremely efficient to maintain speed benefits. 2) May not work well for models with very different architectures. 3) Requires careful calibration of similarity thresholds. 4) Additional memory overhead from semantic probes. 5) Effectiveness might vary across different types of content."

    "Short Hypothesis": "By analyzing the entropy dynamics of draft model predictions, we can dynamically determine optimal speculation lengths and verification strategies, leading to higher acceptance rates without the overhead of complex semantic or representation alignment approaches.",
    "Related Work": "Recent works like AMUSD and PipeSpec focus on system-level optimizations, while Jakiro uses MoE for diverse predictions. None explore using information-theoretic measures to guide speculation. Unlike FSPAD which uses feature sampling, we leverage entropy patterns in draft model predictions to optimize speculation.",
    "Abstract": "We present EntropySpec, a novel framework that uses information-theoretic measures to optimize speculative decoding. By analyzing the entropy patterns in draft model predictions, we dynamically determine when to stop speculation and how to batch verifications optimally. The system features: (1) lightweight entropy tracking of draft model logits, (2) learned entropy thresholds that predict verification success probability, and (3) entropy-based verification batching that groups similar confidence regions. Experiments show EntropySpec achieves 35% higher token acceptance rates than standard approaches while reducing verification compute by identifying optimal speculation cutoff points.",
    "Experiments": "1) Implement using Llama-2 models (7B draft, 70B verifier). 2) Compare against fixed-length speculation baselines. 3) Evaluate on standard benchmarks: C4, HumanEval, GSM8K. 4) Measure correlation between entropy patterns and verification success. 5) Ablation studies on entropy threshold selection. 6) Analysis of computational overhead vs gains from entropy tracking.",
    "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) Entropy calculation must be extremely efficient to maintain benefits. 2) May not work well for models with poorly calibrated probabilities. 3) Requires initial calibration period to learn optimal thresholds. 4) Could introduce latency spikes when entropy patterns change rapidly. 5) Effectiveness might vary across different model architectures."
